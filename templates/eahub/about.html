<h1>About</h1>
<p>The Effective Altruism Hub is here to make it easier for Effective Altruists to get together and do the most good using evidence and reason. Our vision is to provide visibility for EA groups, individuals and organisations, and to provide new ways for Effective Altruists to network. We also wish to combat fragmentation, bottlenecks and inefficiencies within the EA community by building a platform customised to the practical needs of effective altruists and EA organisations. Planned features, such as a custom built cross platform search, will boost the visibility of existing websites and resources from around the EA community, leading to less duplication and increased utility. </p>
<p>The Hub also acts as a valuable source of metadata about the EA movement, which overlaps and strengthens the work of the EA survey. Our decision to redesign the EA Hub is based on our belief that the original Hub had untapped potential which was held back by limitations of design. Our reboot aims to retain features of the original Hub that were most valued by users, but to also make these original features function in a more user friendly and optimised way.</p>
